So I want to share with you some knowledge of \"SHA-1\".\n> All major web browser vendors ceased acceptance of SHA-1 SSL certificates in 2017.[10][11][12] In February 2017, CWI Amsterdam and Google announced they had performed a collision attack against SHA-1, publishing two dissimilar PDF files which produced the same SHA-1 hash.[13][2] But SHA-1 is still secure for HMAC.[14]\nMicrosoft has discontinued SHA-1 code signing support for Windows Update on August 7, 2020. \nI read the paragraph on http://wikipedia.org\nEven the \"git commit\" is generated by SHA-1. Although the SHA-1 collision has been found by Google, I still like this encryption method.\nBy the way, SHA-1, in fact, cannot be reversed, so I don't know how can you read this mail.\n(The \"CKEFGISC{Don+_7e11_0+her_Your_Key_L;ke_7h;s}\" is just the salt, not any key.)\nBut if you read this, will you marry me?"
